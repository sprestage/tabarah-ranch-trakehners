	The choice of a foundation mare is one of the most important that a Trakehner
	breeder can make.  This Canadian born, Abdullah granddaughter was the result
	of careful research for a mare of the old style of Trakehner lines that cross
	so well with the modern Trakehner stallion.  The goal of producing the ideal
	modern Trakehner has been aptly demonstrated in offspring that includes a
	model Trakehner mare (Jaida *M*), and two Trakehner Inspection High Point
	mares (Jädorin and Joriah).

	We look forward to the 2012 inspection where we hope to present our first
	Jägerin granddaughter, Jakira.
